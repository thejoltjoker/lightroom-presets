# Lightroom Workflow

## Introduction

Hi friend! 👋

So you found my Lightroom repository! 📷

It used to be only presets but it's turning into more of a full on workflow for lightroom. It's heavily opinionated but feel free to just look through and get some inspiration to make something great of your own!

The presets are free to use. Some of them are great, others not so great. Some only work for certain type of photos and some work for most.

Whatever you end up using this for I hope it will aid in your workflow! 🎉

## Settings (Develop Presets)

A little explanation of the different classifications I've come up with, might be handy.

### Automatic Presets (user_auto) 🤖

Presets that I normally use for lazy and initial processing of RAW photos.

### Basic Presets (user_basic) 🏭

These presets are the most basic adjustments like camera profiles and such.
I usually apply one of these directly on import.

### HDR Presets (user_hdr) 🌄

Presets related to my HDR photography workflow.

### Toning Presets (user_toning) 🗺️

These are my favorite! They're what makes my photos look a certain way.
They're named based on what was in the photo when I created the preset.
So they remind me of different places as well which is always fun!

## Lightroom (Other Presets)

### Export Presets

I will try and gather some common file export presets I use for various exports.

### Filename Templates

Here I will have my file naming templates.

### Export Actions

#### create_contact_sheet

Creates a contact sheet for all the exported photos and puts in the export folder. Requires [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php "Downlaod ImageMagick") to be installed.

## Keywords 📋

Keyword lists for use in Lightroom.

### Swedish birds 🦆

A list of birds that can be seen in Sweden. Names are in swedish but synonyms are added in latin and english.

## Legacy

I was using the old Lightroom Classic until recently so the .lrtemplate presets are in this folder.
