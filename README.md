# Lightroom Presets
## Introduction
Hi friend! 👋

So you found my Lightroom presets! 📷

Feel free to use them however you want. Some of them are great, others not so great. Some only work for certain type of photos and some work for most.

Whatever you end up using them for I hope it will aid in your workflow! 🎉

## Develop Presets
A little explanation of the different classifications I've come up with, might be handy.

### Automatic Presets (user_auto) 🤖
Presets that I normally use for lazy and initial processing of RAW photos.

### Basic Presets (user_basic) 🏭
These presets are the most basic adjustments like camera profiles and such.
I usually apply one of these directly on import.

### HDR Presets (user_hdr) 🌄
Presets related to my HDR photography workflow.

### Toning Presets (user_toning) 🗺️
These are my favorite! They're what makes my photos look a certain way.
They're named based on what was in the photo when I created the preset.
So they remind me of different places as well which is always fun!


## Export Presets
I will try and gather some common file export presets I use for various exports.


## Filename Templates
Here I will have my file naming templates.
